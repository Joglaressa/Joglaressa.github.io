# Joglaressa's notes

A page of thoughts and useful references.

This site was created using instructions from [The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/github-pages-create-readme.html).

## [Simplified Technical English](https://www.asd-ste100.org/)
I've never tried to write fully compliant STE, but some of ASD's grammar rules are worth adopting as guidelines when writing instruction manuals. Okay, the style is going to be dry and factual (not the thing if your brief is to engage the reader's enthusiasm) but ideal if you need to provide procedural instructions for a complex task, or one that could go horribly wrong. 
I've tried to follow the grammar rules in writing my [guideline](./Notes-on-STE.md) so they're also an example of the style.

## Using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
I started experimenting with Canva's templates when making of courses I'd finished, just to give them a bit more impact. Also, sticking with the limited space of their infographic format made me really have to think what to include, which is a useful reviewing exercise in itself.
