# Joglaressa's notes
A page of thoughts and useful references for technical writing.

I'm a technical writer creating laboratory automation manuals for life sciences applications. My CV is here, if you want to know more about me.

I've never tried to write fully compliant STE, but some of ASD's grammar guidelines are worth adopting as guidelines when writing instruction manuals. Okay, the style will be rather dry and factual (not the thing if your brief is to engage the reader's enthusiasm) but ideal if you need to provide procedural instructions for a complex task, or one that could go horribly wrong.
