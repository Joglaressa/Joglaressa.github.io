General advice

- Shorten long oﬃcial technical names after their ﬁrst use (state the short name). 
- Do not omit subjects, verbs or other nouns to make sentences shorter. 
- Use articles and demonstrative adjectives correctly; do not omit them for brevity. 
- Use ‘we’ when the subject of the sentence is your company. 
- Use the imperative or the simple past, present and future forms of verbs.

- Do not use complex verb forms or auxiliary verbs.
