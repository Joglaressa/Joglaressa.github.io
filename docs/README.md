## CLI Git in 15 lines
When in the project's directory ...  
To take a local copy of repo content:  
`git branch` - what branch are you on?  
`git branch [name]` creates branch  
`git switch` to change branch  
`git status` - changes you made in your local copy differing from your last clone of the repo  
`git pull` - brings you up to date in your local file so beware if you had different content in local  

To put local content back in a GitHub repo:  
`git diff`  
`git add` - stages the local change to be committed  
`git commit` - will commit your changes to the local clone  
`git push` - copies clone to the repo  
This needs the access token but you don't see it when you paste it at the command line  
`git pull` - confirm you're up to date  

## [Simplified Technical English](https://www.asd-ste100.org/)

## Reminders from courses
Old school [Pong](game.html) from this [Udemy JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/code-your-first-game/). [Source](https://github.com/Joglaressa/joglaressa.github.io/blob/main/docs/game.html) is a good reminder of JavaScript syntax and how to embed it in a page.  
Canva files I made to capture key info from [JSON](JSON.pdf) and [markdown](Markdown.pdf) courses.
