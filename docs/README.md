## CLI Git in 15 lines
When in the project's directory ...  
To take a local copy of repo content:  
`git branch` - what branch are you on?  
`git branch [name]` creates branch  
`git switch` to change branch  
`git status` - changes you made in your local copy differing from your last clone of the repo  
`git pull` - brings you up to date in your local file so beware if you had different content in local  

To put local content back in a GitHub repo:  
`git diff`  
`git add` - stages the local change to be committed  
`git commit` - will commit your changes to the local clone  
`git push` - copies clone to the repo  
This needs the access token but you don't see it when you paste it at the command line  
`git pull` - confirm you're up to date

Jane Brayne's description of the [reseach and experimental archaeology](https://janebrayne.wordpress.com/2017/04/04/archer-journey-to-stonehenge-2/) behind her ['Archer, Journey to Stonehenge'](https://janebrayne.wordpress.com/amesbury-archer/) children's book.

Liking clocks and sundials, I was pleased to find this [downloadable card sundial](https://sundialsoc.org.uk/sundial-maker/card-multidial/) (though I suspect the instructions could be better . . . )
